Mr. Explainer:
  By default, characters display the "neutral" emote.
  Any number of lines of dialog can be given following the name of a character (the speaker).
  Syntax *similar **to** markdown* can be *\\used.*
  This includes `inline \`code\\ segments` which can be inside ***`other-*sections* **formatted in other ways**`***.
  All \*such\* \`syntax\` \*\*can\*\* be \\es\\\\caped.

Mrs. Elucidator enters from the right.

Mrs. Elucidator (proud):
  The name of an emote can be specified alongside the name of the speaking character.

Mr. Explainer is shocked.

Mr. Explainer:
  You can?  I've always used a stage direction!

Mr. Company enters from the left, surprised.

Mr. Explainer, Mrs. Elucidator, Mr. Company and Mrs. Crowd:

  Now to hand over to our assistant for a menu demo...
